# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

1. I wrote down what each file contained.  That included classes and what actions the methods took.  Then I was able to look back and see the bigger picture of what was happening.

2. I really had to put myself in the code creator's shoes to figure out what they were thinking when they wrote the code.

3. It felt fairly easy when it came to reading the code and figuring out what was happening.  It was much harder when I had to diagnose problems and fix them.
